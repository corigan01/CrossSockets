# CrossSockets
CrossSockets is a cross platform Socket connection api. This allows a secure connection between two nodes. One node is consisted the server. The server can accept many connections from the client nodes. CrossSockets even supports a maintenance connection (with password). CrossSockets has a password option for automatic hashing of passwords. Passwords will never be sent raw to any of the clients. CrossSockets support a extra-encryption mode which “SUPER” encrypt your data for transfer.
